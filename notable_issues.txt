    this one is very strange since both faces have 
    all features visible, well-lit, and almost no rotation
    the program does find two faces, however the second 
    one is a complete dud and is a re-capture of the first (right-side) face

picture8
    no face is recognized, probably due to rotation

picture9
    only 2/3 faces are recognized, probably because of hand obstruction
