    this one is very strange since both faces have 
    all features visible, well-lit, and almost no rotation
    without alignment, three faces are found when there are only 2
    one of the faces is a messed up/smaller version of an already-found face

picture8
    no face is recognized, probably due to rotation

picture9
    only 2/3 faces are recognized, probably because of hand obstruction
